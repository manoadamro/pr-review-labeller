 ### Attention! ðŸš¨

If you're using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, you'll only be able to use this action for PRs opened within the same repository.

If you're planning to support PRs opened from forks, you can enable the option to  [Send write tokens to workflows from pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks). However, this is a **high risk option**, as described in the docs.

See this comment for more information: https://github.com/xenserver/xenadmin/pull/2875#issuecomment-930281214

You can also use this [workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67249854), which would avoid using such sensitive permissions. See https://github.com/danilo-delbusso/pr-review-labeller/issues/1 for more.

# Update PR Status Labels Action

This action updates the labels of a PR after a review has been added.

It currently supports four labels:

- One Approval label
- Two Approvals label
- Changes Requested label
- Updated PR Label

These labels have to exist in the repository already.

You will simply need to specify their names in the `.yml` configuration.

## Inputs

### `needs-review-label-name`

**Required** Name of the label to show when the PR has zero approvals. Defaults to `needs review`.

### `one-approval-label-name`

**Required** Name of the label to show when the PR has one approval. Defaults to `1 approval`.

### `two-approvals-label-name`

**Required** Name of the label to show when the PR has two approvals. Defaults to `2 approvals`.

### `changes-requested-label-name`

**Required** Name of the label to show when the PR needs changes. Defaults to `needs updating`.

### `updated-pr-label-name`

**Required** Name of the label to show when the PR has been updated (new commits). Defaults to `updated`.

## Environment Variables

## `GITHUB_TOKEN`

The token needs to be added to the yml description in order for the action to call GitHub's API.

## Example usage with default label names

You can replace `pull_request` with `pull_request_target` if you need to.
